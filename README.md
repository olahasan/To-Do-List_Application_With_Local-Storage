## Overview

### The challenge

A simple and intuitive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to add, delete.Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

Your users should be able to:

- Add a new Task
- Delete a task
- find all tasks stored in the browser's local storage even after the page is refreshed

### Links

If you want to open the link in a new tab, you can:

- Press **Ctrl** (or **Cmd** on Mac) while clicking the link.
- Right-click the link and select **Open link in new tab**.

Otherwise, all links will open in the same tab.

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me improve my skills in:

- **HTML**: Structuring web pages and using semantic elements.
- **CSS**: Styling web pages and creating responsive designs.
- **JavaScript**: Manipulating the DOM, handling events, and using local storage.
- **Local Storage**: Understanding how to store and retrieve data in the browser.

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to:

- Add more features such as task categories and due dates.
- Improve the user interface with better styling and animations.
- Implement a search functionality to filter tasks.
- Enhance accessibility to make the application more user-friendly for all users.
